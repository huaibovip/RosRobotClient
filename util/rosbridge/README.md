# rosbridge_client_cpp

Implementation of a C++11 [rosbridge client][wiki_rosbridge] for rosbridge protocol v2.0.

The library was designed to:

- Be robust to communication failures;

- Handle transparently reconnections in case of temporary interruptions of communication;

- Have an interface as similar as possible to the ROS standard one.

## Usage

In order to declare `Publisher`s, `Subscriber`s, `ServiceClient`s, and `ServiceServer`s, you need to create an
instance of the `RosbridgeClient`:

```
#include <rosbridge_client_cpp/rosbridge.h>

auto on_connection = [](){ std::cout << "RosbridgeClient connected" << std::endl; };
auto on_disconnection = [](){ std::cout << "RosbridgeClient disconnected" << std::endl; };
RosbridgeClient rb("localhost", 9090, on_connection, on_disconnection);
```

#### Publisher

```
Publisher my_pub(rb, "/my/topic", "std_msgs/String", 20);
picojson::object json;
json["data"] = picojson::value("Hello There!");
my_pub.publish<picojson::object>(json);
```

#### Subscriber

```
auto my_callback = [](const picojson::object& json){ std::cout << std::to_string(json) << std::endl; };
Subscriber my_sub(rb, "/my/topic", "std_msgs/String", my_callback, 5);
```

#### ServiceClient

```
ServiceClient my_client(rb, "/my/service");
picojson::object json;
json["data"] = picojson::value("Hello There!");
my_client.call(json, std::chrono::seconds(5));
```

#### ServiceServer

```
auto my_callback = [](const picojson::object& request) -> picojson::object
{
    picojson::object response;
    response["success"] = picojson::value(true);
    response["message"] = picojson::value("Hello There!");
    return response;
};
ServiceServer my_server("/my/service", "std_srvs/Trigger", my_callback);
```

## Possible improvements for the future:

- Use condition variables instead of loops with a fixed rate;

- Deallocate orphan `TalkerQueue`s and `ListenerQueue`s;

- Add message type verifications.
